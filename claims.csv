regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United Stat es and foreign countries ; United 
States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military

Facility (“SCIF”), and only individuals with the appropriate security clearance and additional SC I 
permissions were authorized to have access to such national security information . 
16. When the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific classified information was 
exceptional, and the normal criteria for determining eligibility for acce ss to classified infor mation 
were insufficient to pro tect the information from unauthorized disclosure, the United States could 
establish Special Access Programs (“SAPs”) to further protect the classified information.  The number of these programs was to b e kept to an absolute minimum and limited to programs in 
which the number of persons who ordinarily would have access would be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved. Only individuals with the appropri ate security clearance and addi tional SAP permissions were 
authorized to have access to such national security information, which was subject to enhanced 
handling and storage requirements.
